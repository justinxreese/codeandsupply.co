    The way tech meetups work needs to change.
  </p>
  <p>
  The <b>friendships</b> we make in tech meetups aren't restricted by programming
    language.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <b>activities</b> we enjoy to do aren't limited to lectures and
    presentations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Code & Supply is not a meetup, but a club of like-minded people.
    People who are devoted to bettering themselves and creating awesome tech.
